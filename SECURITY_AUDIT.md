### Deprecated Packages
- **critters** (0.0.25): Package is deprecated, not currently in use

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ Remove unused `critters` package: `pnpm remove -D critters`
2. ⚠️ Consider staying on current stable versions for production stability
3. 📝 Test major version updates in a separate branch

### Update Strategy

#### Option 1: Conservative (Recommended for Production)
Keep current versions as they are stable and well-tested:
- Next.js 14 is LTS
- React 18 is stable
- Current setup passes all tests

#### Option 2: Gradual Updates
Update non-breaking dependencies first:
```bash
pnpm update @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom eslint-config-prettier
```

#### Option 3: Major Version Updates
Test in development branch:
```bash
# Create test branch
git checkout -b update/major-versions

# Update Next.js 16 (requires React 19)
pnpm add next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest
pnpm add -D @types/react@latest @types/react-dom@latest

# Update Tailwind 4
pnpm add -D tailwindcss@latest

# Test everything
pnpm test:all:full
pnpm build
```

### Scripts Available

```bash
# Check for vulnerabilities
pnpm audit

# Check for outdated packages
pnpm outdated

# Combined check
pnpm update:check

# Interactive update (choose what to update)
pnpm update:interactive
```

## Notes

- @lhci/cli was intentionally downgraded to 0.13.0 for Node.js 20.9.0 compatibility
- Upgrading to 0.15.1 requires Node.js 20.10+ or resolving the import assertions issue
- All production dependencies are secure and up to date for their major versions
